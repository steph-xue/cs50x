1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

AVG energy = 0.65906
AVG valence = 0.484443
AVG danceability = 0.71646

As the listener's top 100 songs would have an average valence, and above average energy and danceability, I would characterize their audio aura to be
moderately energetic, passionate, and happy, but not a super high energy party vibe. Something like the purple aura color. This aura color pairs
well with passionate music listeners. Purple auras tune in to get amped up, entertained, and moving while they navigate the twists and turns of their day.


2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
   What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

The way we have calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener, because it only takes into account the average of the top
100 songs they listen to. It doesn't take into account other factors, like how frequently the listener has listened to each song. A better way of
calculating this aura would be to take the average of the energy, valence, and danceability of the songs they listen to in relation to how many
times they have listened to each song.
