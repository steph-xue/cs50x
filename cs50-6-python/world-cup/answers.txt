Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
- The time does not appear to increase linearly as the number of simulations increases
- The time appears to increase exponentially as the number of simulations increases by multiples of 10

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
- After around 100 000 simmulations the predictions would be "good enough" as the amount of time taken is still reasonably small ~ 1 s
- At around 1 000 000 simulations or more, it takes almost 10 times as long (10 s), which would cost quite a lot more money
